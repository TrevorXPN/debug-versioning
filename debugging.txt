DEFINITION OF DEBUGGING
Debugging is the process of finding and solving errors in code.

DEFINITION OF A BUG
A bug is an error in code that prevents it in the way it was intended.

A BUG IS A GLITCH THAT PREVENTS THE PROGRAM FROM ACHIEVING DESIRED OUTPUT

TYPES OF ERRORS
A)Syntax errors:
these occur when the code does not follow the syntactical rules eg "<div classhome><div>",
 mistyping/mispelling/incorrect usage of variables, functions and statements.

B)Logic/Logical errors:
these occur when the steps taken to perform the task correctly are not well done eg an infinite loop.

C.)Design bugs:
this is a bug that is carried from the designers to the actual implementation of the code.
this is a bug caused by poor and/or inadequate design decisions.eg poor user interface(UI), WRONG DATATYPES.

D.)Runtime errors:
these errors cannot be noticed until the code has actually been run eg dividing with a null value,
dividing a number by 0, adding/subtracting a string by an integer

WHY DEBUG?
-To remove errors from code
-To save resources(time and money)
-Enables the developers to improve productivity and efficiency

DEBUGGING PRINCIPLES:
=>Bugs caught early,right after you've made them are the easiest to fix because the details are fresh in your
mind and you know exactly where to look

=>Once bugs escape they become very hard to find ie since you most likely dont have the details 
of the code in your mind and the code base has grown

THE DEBUGGING CYCLE
1.Code
2.Test 
3.Then repeat

THE BUGG SEEKING CYCLE
The difference btn debugging and testing
-Debugging is what can i do to fix erronuous code while testing is what i need to do to break my code.

STEPS OF Debugging
1.Plan your attack
2.Backup your files(interchangable) using version control / using git hub to keep track of changes in my software
3.Isolate the block of code that could have the error ie commenting it
4.Finding the actual line / lines with the error or buggs
5.Fix the error don't patch it 
6.Test the fix you have just done 
7.Look for similar buggs

OTHER STEPS AND STRATEGIES:
=>REPRODUCIBILITY
   - The first step is to be able to reproduce the bug.
    Understand the cause and effect before you change the code.

=>REDUCTION
    -finding the simplest test that exibits the bug ie reduce the search space because bugs are not random
    they come from somewhere within the code

=>DEDUCTION
    -Undestanding what the program is doing, since you cannot be able to know there is a bug if you dont know what the 
    code is actually supposed to be doing.

=>PAIR PROGRAMMING
    -Someone else maybe able to see wrong assumptions or mistakes you may have made.
    -Helps you to explain and understand what you are trying to achieve with your code.

=>LEVERAGING EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS
    -Seeking solutions from more experienced programmers

PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO AVOID BUGGS
1.Write clean and easy to read code ie indenting your Code and writing dry code(do not repeat yourself)
2.Commenting, helps you undestand what you are trying to achieve with which parts of your code 
3.Make one change at a time
4.Test your code:
    ->The unit test:
        test functional blocks of your code
    ->The intergration test:
        testing the interaction btn the functional blocks of your code
    ->The test with valid and invalid data:
        testing if your code runs with invalid data 
5.Defensive programming by adding error checking code and throwing exceptions
6.Prioritising which features can't be ommited
7.Incubating(sleeping)
8.Brainstorming

DEBUGGING TOOLS
*Break points;
      ->These help you to see which part of the code is carrying the bugg.
*Linting/lints
NB:
ITS USEFFULE TO USE THE PRINT STATEMENT (console.log)

ASSIGNMENT:
RESEARCH AND USE A DEBUGGING TOOL OF CHOICE
